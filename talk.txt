Getting to know
     Btrace

What is it?

- A dynamic tracing tool for java
- Works on compiled byte code
- Can do cool tricks at runtime

Why might I want to use it?

- Trace/Count/Inspect function
  calls on a running jvm
- Profiling
- Deadlock detection / debugging
- Probably other stuff

But why not logging / debugger /
VisualVM etc?

- works on uninstrumented code
- can attach to running processes
- prints results to console
- properly constrained, the performance
  penalty isn't too terrible

How do I Btrace?

- Must use Hotspot (Oracle) java8
- Must run btrace as same euid as jvm
  (not root)
- Must write a small trace script
